Yes, airplanes have gotten bigger and faster, yes they have. But that doesn't mean they're *that* more efficient.  In fact, they're using more fuel per passenger per km.  The same could be said of cars. Cars use 10 times as much fuel per km as airplanes did in the 1950s.  Cars are quieter, which means they use less fuel. Cars are also quieter because they don't need as many moving parts (fuel tanks, fuel pumps, engines, etc). Cars use a much smaller fuel tank and can be more easily stowed in the overhead compartments, making them a lot easier to operate.  As a result of these advances, cars are a lot more fuel efficient than they were 60 years ago.

If you want to apply an engineer's brain to gun legislation it would look something like this:  1) Define the problem. Like really define it.  2) Use statistical methods to analyze the data.

Analyze it for trends and trends.  3) Use the descriptive statistical analyses to characterize gun violence from every conceivable angle. All the relevant variables are readily available. Even the bits that make people uncomfortable, like gender/race/religion/income. You can't make a good argument for gun control without these variables.  4) Make some guesses as to what legislative measures we want to implement, based on our observations of the descriptive statistics.  This may seem like a pedantic way of looking at things, but when you put it this way it actually makes a lot of sense. We have a wealth of data on gun violence and unfortunately most of it is from the 1970s and 1980s.

All it receives are ambiguous and noisy sensory signals that are only indirectly related to objects in the world. Perception must therefore be a process of inference, in which indeterminate sensory signals are combined with prior expectations or \u2018beliefs\u2019 about the way the world is, to form the brain\u2019s optimal hypotheses of the causes of these sensory signals \u2013 of coffee cups, computers and clouds.  This is called predictive coding. One part of the brain involved is the [anterior cingulate cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2519257/).  The other part is the basal ganglia (also known as the visual cortices), which processes visual inputs and translates them into a type of prediction that the brain uses to make further guesses about the future.  In this view, which is often called \u2018predictive coding\u2019, perception is a form of inference.  When we see a familiar object, we are making a prediction about what it will be like in the future, based on past experiences and our knowledge of how it reacts to that object. In the case of the rubber hand, this prediction was made by tricking the brain into thinking that it was holding a real rubber hand in its hand. When the object wasn't there, the brain made another prediction: that it would be the same thing when it saw the object in the morning, only this time with a different color and texture. This was called the \"rubber hand illusion\"."

I'm not an expert on firearms, but I've seen some folks describe it as being the smallest caliber that you can own without having to fill out paperwork for a Destructive Device from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Because somebody decided at some point that any firearm with a bore larger than half an inch was essentially a cannon.  That's a misconception. There are probably thousands of \"30 cal\" calibers in this world, and they do not all perform the same, and most likely won't fit and fire safely in guns not specifically marked for them.  The reason that most calibers have either a military designation (5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm) or a word after the caliber designation is because no two calibers are exactly the same. They denote the diameter of the bullet, and the length of the brass case.  In the case of x.xx*xx mm, those are military designations, usually NATO. But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see \".30-06 Springfield,\" \".270 Winchester,\" \".223 Remington,\" \"9mm Parabellum,\" \".45 ACP,\" etc."

Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity. However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.  In this scenario, the cheese represents the risk factor in the project, the holes represent the potential failure of that entity to perform the safety mechanism. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible.   In the real world, there is no such thing as an unrepresentative cheese. Every single piece of cheese has flaws in it, flaws that can be fixed by putting more cheese on top of the holes. But in the scenario of the hypothetical cheese model, if every single hole in the cheese failed, it would still be a cheese, just a smaller one."
